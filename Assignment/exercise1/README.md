### Game of Life

You’ll be prompted to implement a parallel version of a variant of the famous Conway’s “_game of life_” ( references: [1](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conway%27s_Game_of_Life), [2](https://conwaylife.com/) ), that is cellular automaton which plays autonomously on a infinite 2D grid.
The game itself has several exciting properties and pertains to a very interesting field, but we leave to the readers going deeper into it at will.
