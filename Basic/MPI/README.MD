### Main references for MPI lectures: 

 - chapter 9 of reference 4 is a nice and detailed introduction to MPI. The final section of the chapter is lecture 7 
 - exercises and tutorials on  MPI are present all over the web. Here a couple of examples:
    - [Here a very good starting point](https://www.mcs.anl.gov/research/projects/mpi/tutorial/index.html)
    - [Another simple tutorial](https://mpitutorial.com/tutorials/) 
    - [A virtual course where I took a lot of materials, including some exercises](https://cvw.cac.cornell.edu/MPIP2P/)
 
### tutorials  (contributed by Niccolo Tosato and Ruggero Lot)
  - tutorial 1: [how to use modules on ORFEO (prepared by N.Tosato)](tutorial_module_system.md)
  - tutorial 2: [compiling and running MPI program on ORFEO (prepared by N.Tosato)](tutorial_mpi_hello_world.md)
  - tutorial 3: [playing with basic MPI program on ORFEO](basic_mpi_exercises.md)
