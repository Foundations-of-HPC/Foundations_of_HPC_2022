This directory contains code for generating a memory mountain, as
described in Computer Systems: A Programmer's Perspective 

clock.{c,h}	- routines for using x86 and Alpha cycle timers
fcyc2.{c,h}	- routines that estimate the number of cycles required 
                  by a function f that takes two arguments.
Makefile	- memory mountain makefile
mountain.c	- program that generates the memory mountain.

(1) set the compiler at the top of Makefile
(2) invoke make
(3) execute the mountain.$COMPILER
(4) copy the output in a file named mountain.dat
(5) use plotmountain.gp to plot the data using gnuplot
    type 'load "plotmountain.gp"' from inside gnuplot
