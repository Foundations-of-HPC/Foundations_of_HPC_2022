<H1>Description</H1>
<B>HPL_xjumpm</B>
computes  the constants  A and C  to jump JUMPM numbers in
the random sequence: X(n+JUMPM) = A*X(n)+C.  The constants encoded in
MULT and IADD  specify  how to jump from one entry in the sequence to
the next.

<H1>Arguments</H1>
<PRE>
JUMPM   (local input)                 const int
        On entry,  JUMPM  specifies  the  number  of entries  in  the
        sequence to jump over. When JUMPM is less or equal than zero,
        A and C are not computed, IRANM is set to IRANN corresponding
        to a jump of size zero.
</PRE>
<PRE>
MULT    (local input)                 int *
        On entry, MULT is an array of dimension 2,  that contains the
        16-lower  and 15-higher bits of the constant  a  to jump from
        X(n) to X(n+1) = a*X(n) + c in the random sequence.
</PRE>
<PRE>
IADD    (local input)                 int *
        On entry, IADD is an array of dimension 2,  that contains the
        16-lower  and 15-higher bits of the constant  c  to jump from
        X(n) to X(n+1) = a*X(n) + c in the random sequence.
</PRE>
<PRE>
IRANN   (local input)                 int *
        On entry, IRANN is an array of dimension 2. that contains the
        16-lower and 15-higher bits of the encoding of X(n).
</PRE>
<PRE>
IRANM   (local output)                int *
        On entry,  IRANM  is an array of dimension 2.   On exit, this
        array  contains respectively  the 16-lower and 15-higher bits
        of the encoding of X(n+JUMPM).
</PRE>
<PRE>
IAM     (local output)                int *
        On entry, IAM is an array of dimension 2. On exit, when JUMPM
        is  greater  than  zero,  this  array  contains  the  encoded
        constant  A  to jump from  X(n) to  X(n+JUMPM)  in the random
        sequence. IAM(0:1)  contains  respectively  the  16-lower and
        15-higher  bits  of this constant  A. When  JUMPM  is less or
        equal than zero, this array is not referenced.
</PRE>
<PRE>
ICM     (local output)                int *
        On entry, ICM is an array of dimension 2. On exit, when JUMPM
        is  greater  than  zero,  this  array  contains  the  encoded
        constant  C  to jump from  X(n)  to  X(n+JUMPM) in the random
        sequence. ICM(0:1)  contains  respectively  the  16-lower and
        15-higher  bits  of this constant  C. When  JUMPM  is less or
        equal than zero, this array is not referenced.
