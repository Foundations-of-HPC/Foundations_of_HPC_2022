<H2>HPL Tuning</H2>

After  having built the executable hpl/bin/&#60arch&#62/xhpl,
one may want to modify the input data file HPL.dat. This file
should  reside  in  the  same  directory  as  the  executable
hpl/bin/&#60arch&#62/xhpl.   An example   HPL.dat   file   is 
provided by default. This file contains information about the
problem sizes, machine configuration,  and algorithm features
to be used by the executable.  It is  31  lines long. All the
selected  parameters  will be printed in the output generated
by the executable.<BR><BR>

We first describe the meaning of each line of this input file
below.  Finally,  <A HREF="tuning.html#tips">a   few   useful 
experimental guide lines</A>  to set up the file are given at
the end of this page.<BR><BR>
<HR NOSHADE>

<H3><A NAME="desc">Description of the HPL.dat File</A></H3>

<STRONG>Line 1</STRONG>:  (unused) Typically  one  would  use
this line for its own good.  For example,  it  could  be used
to summarize the content of the input file.  By  default this 
line reads:
<TT><PRE>
HPL Linpack benchmark input file
</PRE></TT>
 
<HR NOSHADE>
<STRONG>Line 2</STRONG>:  (unused) same as line 1. By default
this line reads:
<TT><PRE>
Innovative Computing Laboratory, University of Tennessee
</PRE></TT>
 
<HR NOSHADE>
<STRONG>Line 3</STRONG>:  the  user  can   choose  where  the
output  should  be  redirected to.  In the case of a file,  a
name  is necessary, and this is  the line  where one wants to 
specify it.  Only the first name on this line is significant.
By default, the line reads:
<TT><PRE>
HPL.out  output file name (if any)
</PRE></TT>
 
This  means  that if  one chooses to redirect the output to a
file, the file will be called "HPL.out". The rest of the line
is unused,  and this space to put some informative comment on
the meaning of this line.<BR><BR>
 
<HR NOSHADE>
<STRONG>Line 4</STRONG>: This line specifies where the output
should go.  The  line  is  formatted,  it  must  begin with a 
positive integer,  the rest is unsignificant. 3  choices  are
possible  for  the  positive integer, 6 means that the output
will go the standard output,  7  means  that the  output will
go to the standard error.  Any  other integer means that  the
output should be redirected to a file,  which  name has  been
specified  in the line above. This line by default reads:
<TT><PRE>
6        device out (6=stdout,7=stderr,file)
</PRE></TT>
which  means  that  the  output generated  by  the executable
should be redirected to the standard output.<BR><BR>
 
<HR NOSHADE>
<STRONG>Line 5</STRONG>: This  line  specifies  the number of
problem sizes to be executed. This number should be less than
or equal to 20.  The first  integer is significant,  the rest
is ignored. If the line reads:
<TT><PRE>
3        # of problems sizes (N)
</PRE></TT>
this  means  that  the user is willing to run 3 problem sizes
that will be specified in the next line.<BR><BR>
 
<HR NOSHADE>
<STRONG>Line 6</STRONG>: This line specifies the problem sizes
one wants to run.  Assuming  the  line  above  started with 3,
the  3  first positive  integers  are significant, the rest is
ignored. For example:
<TT><PRE>
3000 6000 10000    Ns
</PRE></TT>
means that one wants xhpl to run 3 (specified in line 5)
problem sizes, namely 3000, 6000 and 10000.<BR><BR>
 
<HR NOSHADE>
<STRONG>Line 7</STRONG>: This line  specifies  the number  of
block sizes to be runned. This number should be less than  or
equal to 20.  The first integer  is significant,  the rest is
ignored. If the line reads:
<TT><PRE>
5        # of NBs
</PRE></TT>
this means that the user is willing to use 5 block sizes that
will be specified in the next line.<BR><BR>
 
<HR NOSHADE>
<STRONG>Line 8</STRONG>:  This line specifies the block sizes
one  wants  to run.  Assuming  the  line above started with 5,
the  5  first positive integers  are  significant, the rest is 
ignored. For example:
<TT><PRE>
80 100 120 140 160 NBs
</PRE></TT>
means  that  one  wants  xhpl  to use 5 (specified in line 7)
block sizes, namely 80, 100, 120, 140 and 160.<BR><BR>

<HR NOSHADE>
<STRONG>Line 9</STRONG>:  This  line specifies  how  the  MPI
processes  should be mapped  onto the nodes of your platform.
There are currently two possible mappings,  namely  row-  and
column-major. This feature is mainly useful  when these nodes
are themselves multi-processor computers. A row-major mapping
is recommended.<BR><BR>
 
<HR NOSHADE>
<STRONG>Line 10</STRONG>: This line specifies  the  number of
process grid to be runned.  This  number  should be less than
or equal to 20. The first integer is significant, the rest is
ignored. If the line reads:
<TT><PRE>
2        # of process grids (P x Q)
</PRE></TT>
this  means  that you are willing to try 2 process grid sizes 
that will be specified in the next line.<BR><BR>
 
<HR NOSHADE>
<STRONG>Line 11-12</STRONG>:  These  two  lines  specify  the  
number of process rows  and  columns of each grid you want to
run on.  Assuming the line above (10)  started with 2,  the 2
first  positive integers of those two lines  are significant,
the rest  is ignored. For example:
<TT><PRE>
1 2          Ps
6 8          Qs
</PRE></TT>
means that one wants to run  xhpl  on  2  process grids (line
10), namely 1-by-6 and 2-by-8. Note: In  this example,  it is
required then  to  start  xhpl  on  at  least  16  nodes (max
of Pi-by-Qi).  The runs on the two grids will be consecutive.
If one was starting xhpl on more than 16 nodes, say 52,  only
6 would be used for the first grid (1x6)  and  then 16  (2x8)
would  be used for the second grid. The fact that you started
the MPI job on 52 nodes, will not make  HPL  use all of them.
In this example,  only 16 would be used.  If one wants to run 
xhpl  with  52  processes  one needs  to specify a grid of 52
processes, for example the following lines would do the job:
<TT><PRE>
4  2         Ps
13 8         Qs
</PRE></TT>
 
<HR NOSHADE>
<STRONG>Line 13</STRONG>: This line specifies  the  threshold
to which the residuals should be compared with. The residuals
should be or order 1, but are  in practice slightly less than
this, typically 0.001.  This  line  is made of a real number,
the rest is not significant. For example:
<TT><PRE>
16.0         threshold
</PRE></TT>
In practice,  a value of  16.0  will  cover  most cases.  For
various reasons,  it  is possible  that some of the residuals
become slightly larger, say for example 35.6.  xhpl will flag
those runs  as  failed,  however  they  can be  considered as
correct. A run should be considered as failed if the residual
is a few order of magnitude bigger than 1 for example 10^6 or
more. Note:  if one was  to specify  a threshold of  0.0, all
tests  would be flagged  as failed, even though the answer is
likely  to  be  correct.  It is allowed to specify a negative 
value for this threshold,  in which case  the checks  will be 
by-passed,  no matter what the threshold value is, as soon as
it  is  negative.  This  feature  allows  to  save  time when 
performing a lot of experiments,  say for instance during the
tuning phase. Example:
<TT><PRE>
-16.0        threshold
</PRE></TT>
 
<HR NOSHADE>
The remaning lines  allow  to specifies algorithmic features.
xhpl  will  run  all  possible combinations of those for each
problem  size,  block size, process grid combination. This is
handy  when one looks for an "optimal" set of parameters.  To
understand  a little bit better,  let  say  first a few words
about  the algorithm implemented in HPL. Basically this is  a
right-looking  version  with  row-partial pivoting. The panel
factorization is matrix-matrix operation based and recursive,
dividing the panel into  NDIV  subpanels  at each step.  This
part  of  the   panel   factorization  is  denoted  below  by
"recursive  panel  fact.  (RFACT)".  The recursion stops when
the  current panel  is made of less  than or equal  to  NBMIN
columns. At that point, xhpl uses a  matrix-vector  operation
based  factorization  denoted   below  by  "PFACTs".  Classic
recursion  would  then  use  NDIV=2,   NBMIN=1.   There   are
essentially   3   numerically  equivalent  LU   factorization 
algorithm  variants  (left-looking, Crout and right-looking).
In HPL, one can choose  every one of those for the  RFACT, as
well as the PFACT.  The following lines of HPL.dat allows you
to set those parameters.<BR><BR>
<STRONG>Lines 14-21: (Example 1)</STRONG>
<TT><PRE>
3       # of panel fact
0 1 2   PFACTs (0=left, 1=Crout, 2=Right)
4       # of recursive stopping criterium
1 2 4 8 NBMINs (>= 1)
3       # of panels in recursion
2 3 4   NDIVs
3       # of recursive panel fact.
0 1 2   RFACTs (0=left, 1=Crout, 2=Right)
</PRE></TT>
 
This  example  would  try all variants of PFACT, 4 values for
NBMIN,  namely 1, 2, 4 and 8,  3 values for NDIV namely 2,  3 
and 4, and all variants for RFACT.<BR><BR>
<STRONG>Lines 14-21: (Example 2)</STRONG>
<TT><PRE>
2       # of panel fact
2 0     PFACTs (0=left, 1=Crout, 2=Right)
2       # of recursive stopping criterium
4 8     NBMINs (>= 1)
1       # of panels in recursion
2       NDIVs
1       # of recursive panel fact.
2       RFACTs (0=left, 1=Crout, 2=Right)
</PRE></TT>
This example  would  try  2  variants  of  PFACT namely right
looking and left looking, 2 values for NBMIN, namely 4 and 8,
1 value for NDIV namely 2, and one variant for RFACT.<BR><BR>
 
<HR NOSHADE>
In the  main loop  of the algorithm,  the  current  panel  of
column  is broadcast  in process rows  using  a virtual  ring
topology. HPL offers various choices and one most likely want
to use the increasing ring modified encoded as 1. 3 and 4 are
also good choices.<BR><BR>
<STRONG>Lines 22-23: (Example 1)</STRONG>
<TT><PRE>
1       # of broadcast
1       BCASTs (0=1rg,1=1rM,2=2rg,3=2rM,4=Lng,5=LnM)
</PRE></TT>
This will cause HPL  to broadcast the current panel using the
increasing ring modified topology.<BR><BR>
<STRONG>Lines 22-23: (Example 2)</STRONG>
<TT><PRE>
2       # of broadcast
0 4     BCASTs (0=1rg,1=1rM,2=2rg,3=2rM,4=Lng,5=LnM)
</PRE></TT>
This will cause  HPL to broadcast the current panel using the
increasing   ring  virtual  topology  and  the  long  message
algorithm.<BR><BR>
 
<HR NOSHADE>
<STRONG>Lines 24-25</STRONG> allow to specify  the look-ahead
depth used by HPL.  A depth of 0  means  that  the next panel
is  factorized  after  the  update  by  the  current panel is
completely finished.   A  depth of  1  means  that  the  next
panel  is  immediately  factorized  after being updated.  The 
update  by  the  current panel is then finished. A depth of k
means that the k next panels are factorized immediately after
being updated.  The  update  by  the  current  panel  is then 
finished.  It  turns out that a depth of 1  seems to give the
best results,  but  may need a large problem size  before one
can  see  the performance  gain. So use 1, if you do not know
better,  otherwise  you  may want  to  try 0.  Look-ahead  of
depths 3  and  larger  will  probably  not  give  you  better
results.<BR><BR>
<STRONG>Lines 24-25: (Example 1):</STRONG>
<TT><PRE>
1       # of lookahead depth
1       DEPTHs (>=0)
</PRE></TT>
This will cause HPL to use a look-ahead of depth 1.<BR><BR>
<STRONG>Lines 24-25: (Example 2):</STRONG>
<TT><PRE>
2       # of lookahead depth
0 1     DEPTHs (>=0)
</PRE></TT>
This will cause HPL to use a look-ahead of depths 0 and 1.<BR><BR>

<HR NOSHADE>
<STRONG>Lines 26-27</STRONG>  allow  to  specify  the  swapping
algorithm  used  by  HPL for  all tests.  There  are  currently
two  swapping  algorithms   available,  one  based  on  "binary
exchange"  and  the   other  one   based  on   a  "spread-roll"
procedure  (also  called   "long"  below).  For  large  problem
sizes, this last one is likely to be more efficient.  The  user
can also choose to mix both variants, that is "binary-exchange"
for a number of columns less  than a threshold value,  and then
the  "spread-roll" algorithm.  This  threshold  value  is  then 
specified on Line 27.<BR><BR>
<STRONG>Lines 26-27: (Example 1):</STRONG>
<TT><PRE>
1       SWAP (0=bin-exch,1=long,2=mix)
60      swapping threshold
</PRE></TT>
This  will  cause  HPL  to  use  the "long" or  "spread-roll" 
swapping algorithm.  Note  that a threshold  is specified  in
that example but not used by HPL.<BR><BR>
<STRONG>Lines 26-27: (Example 2):</STRONG>
<TT><PRE>
2       SWAP (0=bin-exch,1=long,2=mix)
60      swapping threshold
</PRE></TT>
This  will  cause  HPL  to  use  the "long" or  "spread-roll" 
swapping algorithm  as  soon as there is more than 60 columns
in the row panel. Otherwise, the "binary-exchange"  algorithm
will be used instead.<BR><BR>

<HR NOSHADE>
<STRONG>Line 28</STRONG>  allows  to specify whether the upper
triangle  of  the  panel  of  columns  should   be  stored  in
no-transposed  or transposed form. Example:
<TT><PRE>
0            L1 in (0=transposed,1=no-transposed) form
</PRE></TT>

<HR NOSHADE>
<STRONG>Line 29</STRONG> allows  to specify whether the panel 
of rows  U  should be stored in  no-transposed  or transposed 
form. Example:
<TT><PRE>
0            U  in (0=transposed,1=no-transposed) form
</PRE></TT>

<HR NOSHADE>
<STRONG>Line 30</STRONG> enables / disables the equilibration 
phase. This option  will not be used unless you selected 1 or
2 in Line 26. Example:
<TT><PRE>
1            Equilibration (0=no,1=yes)
</PRE></TT>

<HR NOSHADE>
<STRONG>Line 31</STRONG> allows  to  specify the alignment in
memory for the memory  space  allocated  by  HPL.  On  modern
machines, one probably wants to use  4,  8  or 16.  This  may 
result in a tiny amount of memory wasted. Example:
<TT><PRE>
8       memory alignment in double (> 0)
</PRE></TT>

<H3><A NAME="tips">Guide Lines</A></H3>

<OL>
<LI>Figure  out  a  good block size  for  the matrix multiply
routine.  The best method  is to try a few out. If you happen
to know  the block size  used  by the matrix-matrix  multiply
routine,  a  small  multiple of that block size will do fine.
This particular topic is discussed in the
<A HREF="faqs.html#blsize">FAQs</A> section.<BR><BR>

<LI>The process mapping  should  not matter  if  the nodes of
your platform are single processor computers.  If these nodes
are multi-processors, a row-major mapping is recommended.<BR><BR>

<LI>HPL likes "square" or slightly flat process grids. Unless
you  are using  a very small process grid, stay away from the 
1-by-Q and P-by-1 process grids. This particular topic is also
discussed in the <A HREF="faqs.html#grid">FAQs</A> section.<BR><BR>

<LI>Panel factorization  parameters:  a  good  start  are the
following for the lines 14-21:
<TT><PRE>
1       # of panel fact
1       PFACTs (0=left, 1=Crout, 2=Right)
2       # of recursive stopping criterium
4 8     NBMINs (>= 1)
1       # of panels in recursion
2       NDIVs
1       # of recursive panel fact.
2       RFACTs (0=left, 1=Crout, 2=Right)
</PRE></TT>

<LI>Broadcast parameters: at this time it is far from obvious
to me what the best setting is,  so i would probably try them
all.  If  I  had  to guess  I would probably  start  with the 
following for the lines 22-23:
<TT><PRE>
2       # of broadcast
1 3     BCASTs (0=1rg,1=1rM,2=2rg,3=2rM,4=Lng,5=LnM)
</PRE></TT>
The best broadcast  depends  on your problem size and harware
performance. My take is that 4 or 5  may be  competitive  for
machines  featuring  very  fast nodes  comparatively  to  the 
network.<BR><BR>

<LI>Look-ahead depth: as mentioned above 0 or 1 are likely to 
be the best choices.  This also  depends  on the problem size
and machine configuration, so I would try "no look-ahead (0)"
and "look-ahead of depth 1 (1)". That is for lines 24-25:
<TT><PRE>
2       # of lookahead depth
0 1     DEPTHs (>=0)
</PRE></TT>

<LI>Swapping: one  can select only one of the three algorithm 
in the input file. Theoretically, mix (2) should win, however
long (1) might just be good enough. The  difference should be
small between those two assuming  a swapping threshold of the 
order of the block size (NB) selected. If  this  threshold is
very large, HPL will use bin_exch (0) most of the time and if
it  is  very  small  (< NB) long (1)  will always be used. In 
short  and  assuming  the  block size (NB)  used is say 60, I 
would choose for the lines 26-27:
<TT><PRE>
2       SWAP (0=bin-exch,1=long,2=mix)
60      swapping threshold 
</PRE></TT>
I would also try the long variant.  For  a very  small number 
of processes  in every column of the process grid  (say < 4),
very little performance difference should be observable.<BR><BR>

<LI>Local storage: I do not think Line 28 matters.  Pick 0 in
doubt. Line 29 is more important.  It controls  how the panel
of rows should be stored. No doubt 0 is better. The caveat is
that in that case the matrix-multiply function is called with
( Notrans, Trans, ... ), that is C := C - A B^T.   Unless the 
computational  kernel  you are using  has  a very poor  (with
respect to performance) implementation of that case,  and  is
much more efficient with  ( Notrans, Notrans, ... ) just pick
0 as well.  So, my choice:
<TT><PRE>
0       L1 in (0=transposed,1=no-transposed) form
0       U  in (0=transposed,1=no-transposed) form
</PRE></TT>

<LI>Equilibration: It  is hard to tell  whether equilibration
should always be performed or not. Not knowing much about the
random matrix generated  and because the overhead is so small
compared to the possible gain, I turn it on all the time.
<TT><PRE>
1       Equilibration (0=no,1=yes)
</PRE></TT>

<LI>For alignment, 4 should be plenty,  but just to be safe,
one may want to pick 8 instead.
<TT><PRE>
8       memory alignment in double (> 0)
</PRE></TT>
