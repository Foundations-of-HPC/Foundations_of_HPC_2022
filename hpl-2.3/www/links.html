<H3><A NAME="mpi_libs">Message Passing Interface (MPI)</A></H3>

MPI  is  a  library  specification  for  message-passing,  proposed  as a
standard  by  a  broadly  based committee  of  vendors, implementors, and
users.  Machine-specific (optimized)  as  well  as  freely available  MPI
libraries  are  available  for  a large  variety of systems.  Browse  the
<A HREF = "http://www.mcs.anl.gov/mpi">Message  Passing  Interface  (MPI)
standard web page</A> for more information.<BR><BR>

<H3><A NAME="blas_libs">Basic Linear Algebra Subroutines (BLAS)</A></H3>

The  <A HREF = "http://www.netlib.org/blas">BLAS</A>  are   high  quality
"building  block"   routines  for  performing  basic  vector  and  matrix 
operations.  A  lot  of  "BLAS-related"  information can be found at this 
site.  In  particular,  a  reference implementation  is  available.  This
reference   implementation  is  <STRONG>not  optimized</STRONG>  for  any
system, and  it is therefore <STRONG>not  recommended</STRONG>  to use it
for  benchmarking  purposes</STRONG>.
However, <A HREF = "http://www.netlib.org/blas/faq.html">machine-specific
optimized  BLAS  libraries</A> are  available  for  a variety of computer
systems.   For  further  details,    please  contact  your  local  vendor
representative.  Alternatively,  one  may  also consider  using automatic
code  generators such as <A HREF="http://www.netlib.org/atlas">ATLAS</A>.
This  tool  automatically   generates   a  complete   and  optimized BLAS
library for a large variety of modern systems.<BR><BR>

<H3><A NAME="vsip_libs">Vector Signal Image Processing Library (VSIPL)</A></H3>

<A HREF = "http://www.vsipl.org">VSIPL</A>  is  an API defined by an open
standard  comprised of  embedded signal and image processing hardware and
software  vendors,  academia,  users,  and  government  labs.  A  lot  of
"VSIPL-related"  information can be found at this site.  In particular, a
reference implementation is available.  Machine-specific  optimized VSIPL
libraries are available  for a variety of computer systems.  For  further
details, please contact your local vendor representative.<BR><BR>

<H3>TOP 500 List</H3>

The  <A HREF  = "http://www.netlib.org/benchmark/top500.html">TOP 500</A>
is  an  ordered list of the 500 most powerful computer systems worldwide.
Computers   are   ranked  in  this  list  by  their  performance  on  the

<H3>Parallel Dense Linear Algebra Software Libraries</H3>

Browse the <A HREF="http://www.netlib.org">Netlib software repository</A>
or  the <A HREF="http://www.nhse.org">National HPCC Software Exchange</A>
to find a large collection of freely available linear algebra libraries.
