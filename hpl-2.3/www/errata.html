<H2>HPL Errata - Bugs</H2>

<H3>Issues fixed in Version 2.1, October 26th, 2012</H3>

The output now reports exact time stamps before and after the
execution of the solver function pdgesv() was run. This could
allow for accurate accounting of running time for data center
management   purposes.    For   example  as  reporting  power
consumption.  This  is  important  for  the Green500 project.<BR><BR>

Fixed an out-of-bounds access to arrays  in the HPL_spreadN()
and  HPL_spreadT()  functions.  This  may cause  segmentation
fault signals. It was reported by Stephen Whalen from Cray.<BR><BR>

<H3>Issues fixed in Version 2.0, September 10th, 2008</H3>

Gregory Bauer  found  a  problem  size  corresponding  to the
periodicity of the pseudo-random matrix generator used in the
HPL  timing  program. This causes  the  LU  factorization  to
detect the singularity of the input matrix as it should have.<BR><BR>

A problem size of 2^17 = 131072 causes columns 14 modulo 2^14
(i.e. 16384)  (starting from 0)  to be bitwise identical on a
homogeneous platform.  Every problem size  being a power of 2
and larger than  2^15  will  feature a similar problem if one
searches far enough in the columns of the square input matrix.<BR><BR>

The pseudo-random  generator  uses  the  linear  congruential
algorithm:  X(n+1) = (a * X(n) + c) mod m as described in the
Art of Computer  Programming, Knuth 1973,  Vol. 2. In the HPL
case, m is set to 2^31.<BR><BR>

It is very important  to realize that this issue is a problem
of  the  testing  part  of the  HPL software.  The  numerical
properties  of the  algorithms  used in the factorization and
the solve should not be questioned because of this.  In fact,
this is just the opposite: the factorization demonstrated the
weakness of the testing part of the software by detecting the
singularity of the input matrix.<BR><BR>

This issue of  the testing program  is not easy to fix.  This
pseudo-random  generator  has  very useful properties despite
this.  It is  thus currently recommended to HPL users willing
to test matrices of size larger than  2^15  to  not use power
twos.<BR><BR>

This  issue  has  been fixed by  changing  the  pseudo-random
matrix  generator.   Now the  periodicity of the generator is
2^64.<BR><BR>

<H3>Issues fixed in Version 1.0b, December 15th, 2004</H3>

When the matrix size is such that one needs  more  than 16 GB
per  MPI  rank,  the  intermediate  calculation  (mat.ld+1) *
mat.nq in  HPL_pdtest.c  ends up  overflowing  because  it is
done using  32-bit arithmetic.   This issue has been fixed by
typecasting to size_t; Thanks to John Baron.<BR><BR>

<H3>Issues fixed in Version 1.0a, January 20th, 2004</H3>

The  MPI  process  grid numbering scheme defaults now to row-
major ordering. This option can now be selected at run time.<BR><BR>

The  inlined  assembly  timer  routine  that  was causing the
compilation to fail when using gcc version  3.3 and above has
been removed from the package.<BR><BR>

Various building problems on the T3E have been fixed;  Thanks
to Edward Anderson.<BR><BR>

<H3>Issues fixed in Version 1.0, September 27th, 2000</H3>

Due to a  couple errors  spotted in the  VSIPL  port  of  the
software,  the  distribution  contained  in  the  tar file of
September 9th, 2000 had been updated on September 27th,  2000
with a corrected  distribution.  <STRONG>These  problems were
not affecting in any way possible the  BLAS  version  of  the
software.</STRONG>  If you are using  the  VSIPL port of HPL,
and  want  to  make  sure  you are  indeed  using  the latest
corrected version, please  check  the  date  contained in the
file HPL.build.log contained in the main directory.<BR><BR>
