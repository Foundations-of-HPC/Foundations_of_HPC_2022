<H2>HPL Scalability Analysis</H2>

The <A HREF = "scalability.html#model">machine model</A> used for the
analysis is first described.  This crude model is then used  to first

<H3><A NAME = "model">The Machine Model</A></H3>

Distributed-memory computers consist of processors that are connected
using  a message passing interconnection network.  Each processor has
its own memory called the local memory,  which  is accessible only to
that processor.  As the time to access a remote memory is longer than
the time to access a local one,  such computers are often referred to
as Non-Uniform Memory Access (NUMA) machines.<BR><BR>

The interconnection network  of our machine model is static,  meaning
that   it   consists  of  point-to-point  communication  links  among
processors.  This  type  of  network  is also referred to as a direct
network as opposed to dynamic networks.  The  latter  are constructed 
from switches and communication links.  These links  are  dynamically
connected  to one another by the switching elements to establish,  at
run time, the paths between processors memories.<BR><BR>
 
The  interconnection  network  of the two-dimensional  machine  model
considered here is a static,  fully  connected physical topology.  It
is also assumed  that  processors  can be treated  equally  in  terms
of  local performance  and  that  the  communication rate between two
processors depends on the processors considered.<BR><BR>

Our model assumes  that  a processor can send or receive data on only
one of its communication ports at a time  (assuming  it has more than
one). In the literature,  this  assumption is also referred to as the
one-port communication model.<BR><BR>
 
The time spent to communicate  a message between two given processors
is called the communication time Tc.   In  our machine model,  Tc  is
approximated  by  a  linear  function  of  the  number  L  of  double
precision (64-bits) items communicated.  Tc is the sum of the time to
prepare the message for transmission (alpha) and the time  (beta * L)
taken  by the message of length  L  to traverse  the network  to  its 
destination, i.e.,<BR><BR>
<CENTER>
Tc = alpha + beta L.<BR><BR>
</CENTER>

Finally,   the   model  assumes  that  the  communication  links  are
bi-directional,  that is,  the time  for two processors  to send each 
other a message of length L is also Tc.  A processor  can send and/or
receive  a message on only one of  its communication links at a time.
In particular, a processor can send a message while receiving another
message from the processor it is sending to at the same time.<BR><BR>
 
Since this document is only concerned with regular local dense linear
algebra  operations,  the time taken to perform  one  floating  point 
operation  is  assumed  to  be  summarized by  three constants  gam1, 
gam2 and gam3. These quantitites are flop rates approximations of the
vector-vector,  matrix-vector  and matrix-matrix operations for  each
processor.  This  very  crude approximation summarizes all  the steps
performed  by a processor  to achieve such a computation.  Obviously,
such a model neglects all the phenomena  occurring  in  the processor
components,  such as cache misses, pipeline startups, memory load  or
store, floating point arithmetic and so on,  that  may  influence the
value  of  these  constants  as  a function  of the  problem size for
example.<BR><BR>
 
Similarly,  the model  does  not make any assumption on the amount of
physical memory per node.  It  is  assumed that if a process has been
spawn  on  a processor,  one  has  ensured  that  enough  memory  was 
available  on that processor. In other words, swapping will not occur
during the modeled computation.<BR><BR>
 
<STRONG>
This  machine  model  is  a very crude approximation that is designed
specifically  to  illustrate  the cost of the dominant factors of our
particular case.<BR><BR>

<H3><A NAME="pfact">Panel Factorization and Broadcast</A></H3>

Let  consider  an  M-by-N  panel distributed over a P-process column.
Because  of the recursive formulation of the panel factorization,  it
is  reasonable to consider  that  the floating point operations  will
be performed at matrix-matrix multiply "speed".  For  every column in
the panel a binary-exchange is performed on 2*N data items. When this
panel is broadcast,  what  matters  is the time that the next process
column  will  spend  in this  communication operation.  Assuming  one
chooses the <A HREF="algorithm.html#bcast">increasing-ring (modified)
variant</A>,  only  one  message needs to be taken into account.  The
execution  time  of the panel factorization and broadcast can thus be
approximated by:<BR><BR>
<CENTER>
Tpfact( M, N ) = (M/P - N/3) N^2 gam3 + N log(P)( alpha + beta 2 N ) +
alpha + beta M N / P.<BR><BR>
</CENTER>
<HR NOSHADE>

<H3><A NAME="updat">Trailing Submatrix Update</A></H3>

Let  consider  the  update  phase  of an  N-by-N  trailing  submatrix
distributed on a P-by-Q process grid.  From  a computational point of
view one has to (triangular) solve N right-hand-sides  and  perform a 
local rank-NB update of this trailing submatrix. Assuming one chooses
the <A HREF="algorithm.html#update">long variant</A>,  the  execution
time of the update operation can be approximated by:<BR><BR>
<CENTER>
Tupdate( N, NB ) = gam3 ( N NB^2 / Q + 2 N^2 NB / ( P Q ) ) +
alpha ( log( P ) + P - 1 ) + 3 beta N NB / Q.<BR><BR>
</CENTER>
The constant "3" in front of the "beta" term is obtained  by counting
one for the (logarithmic) spread phase and two for the rolling phase;
In the case of bi-directional links  this constant 3 should therefore
be only a 2.<BR><BR>
<HR NOSHADE>

<H3><A NAME="backs">Backward Substitution</A></H3>

The number of floating point operations performed during the backward
substitution in given by  N^2 / (P*Q).  Because of the lookahead, the
communication cost  can be approximated at each step  by two messages
of length NB, i.e.,  the time  to  communicate  the NB-piece  of  the 
solution vector from one diagonal block of the matrix to another.  It
follows that the execution time of the backward substitution  can  be
approximated by:<BR><BR>
<CENTER>
Tbacks( N, NB ) = gam2 N^2  / (P Q) + N ( alpha / NB + 2 beta ).<BR><BR>
</CENTER>
<HR NOSHADE>

<H3><A NAME="total">Putting it All Together</A></H3>

The total execution time of the algorithm described above is given by<BR><BR>
<CENTER>
Sum(k=0,N,NB)[Tpfact( N-k, NB ) + Tupdate( N-k-NB, NB )] +
Tbacks( N, NB ).<BR><BR>
</CENTER>
That is, by only considering only the dominant term in alpha, beta and
gam3:<BR><BR>
<CENTER>
Thpl = 2 gam3 N^3  / ( 3 P Q ) + beta N^2 (3 P + Q) / ( 2 P Q ) +
alpha N ((NB + 1) log(P) + P) / NB.<BR><BR>
</CENTER>
The serial execution time is given by Tser = 2 gam3 N^3  / 3. If we
define the parallel efficiency  E  as the ratio  Tser / ( P Q Thpl ), we
obtain:<BR><BR>
<CENTER>
E = 1 / ( 1 + 3 beta (3 P + Q) / ( 4 gam3 N ) +
3 alpha P Q ((NB + 1) log(P) + P) / (2 N^2 NB gam3) ).<BR><BR>
</CENTER>
This  last equality  shows  that when the memory usage per  processor
N^2 / (P Q)  is maintained  constant, the parallel efficiency  slowly
decreases  only  because of the alpha term.  The communication volume
(the beta term) however remains constant.  Due to these results,  HPL
is said to be <STRONG>scalable</STRONG> not only with respect  to the
amount of computation,  but also  with  respect  to the communication
volume.<BR><BR>
