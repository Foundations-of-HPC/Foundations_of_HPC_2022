/* 
 * Purpose
 * =======
 *
 * HPL_timer_cputime returns the cpu time.  If HPL_USE_CLOCK is defined,
 * the  clock() function is used to return an approximation of processor
 * time used by the program.  The value returned is the CPU time used so
 * far as a clock_t;  to get the number of seconds used,  the result  is
 * divided by  CLOCKS_PER_SEC.  This function is part of the  ANSI/ISO C
 * standard library.  If  HPL_USE_TIMES is defined, the times() function
 * is used instead.  This  function  returns  the current process times.
 * times() returns the number of clock ticks that have elapsed since the
 * system has been up.  Otherwise and by default,  the  standard library
 * function getrusage() is used.
