/* 
 * Purpose
 * =======
 *
 * HPL_ptimer provides a  "stopwatch"  functionality  cpu/wall  timer in
 * seconds.  Up to  64  separate timers can be functioning at once.  The
 * first call starts the timer,  and the second stops it.  This  routine
 * can be disenabled  by calling HPL_ptimer_disable(),  so that calls to
 * the timer are ignored.  This feature can be used to make sure certain
 * sections of code do not affect timings,  even  if  they call routines
 * which have HPL_ptimer calls in them. HPL_ptimer_enable()  will enable
 * the  timer  functionality.  One  can retrieve  the current value of a
 * timer by calling
 *  
 * t0 = HPL_ptimer_inquire( HPL_WALL_TIME | HPL_CPU_TIME, I )
 *  
 * where  I  is the timer index in  [0..64).  To  inititialize the timer
 * functionality, one must have called HPL_ptimer_boot() prior to any of
 * the functions mentioned above.
 *
 * Arguments
 * =========
 *
 * I       (global input)                const int
 *         On entry, I specifies the timer to stop/start.
