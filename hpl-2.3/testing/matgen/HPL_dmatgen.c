/* 
 * Purpose
 * =======
 *
 * HPL_dmatgen generates (or regenerates) a random matrix A.
 *  
 * The  pseudo-random  generator uses the linear congruential algorithm:
 * X(n+1) = (a * X(n) + c) mod m  as  described  in the  Art of Computer
 * Programming, Knuth 1973, Vol. 2.
 *
 * Arguments
 * =========
 *
 * M       (input)                       const int
 *         On entry,  M  specifies  the number  of rows of the matrix A.
 *         M must be at least zero.
 *
 * N       (input)                       const int
 *         On entry,  N specifies the number of columns of the matrix A.
 *         N must be at least zero.
 *
 * A       (output)                      double *
 *         On entry, A points to an array of dimension (LDA,N). On exit,
 *         this  array  contains   the   coefficients  of  the  randomly
 *         generated matrix.
 *
 * LDA     (input)                       const int
 *         On entry, LDA specifies the leading dimension of the array A.
 *         LDA must be at least max(1,M).
 *
 * ISEED   (input)                       const int
 *         On entry, ISEED  specifies  the  seed  number to generate the
 *         matrix A. ISEED must be at least zero.
