/* 
 * Purpose
 * =======
 *
 * HPL_jumpit jumps in the random sequence from the number  X(n) encoded
 * in IRANN to the number  X(m)  encoded in  IRANM using the constants A
 * and C encoded in MULT and IADD: X(m) = A * X(n) + C.  The constants A
 * and C obviously depend on m and n,  see  the function  HPL_xjumpm  in
 * order to initialize them.
 *
 * Arguments
 * =========
 *
 * MULT    (local input)                 int *
 *         On entry, MULT is an array of dimension 2, that contains the
 *         16-lower and 15-higher bits of the constant A.
 *
 * IADD    (local input)                 int *
 *         On entry, IADD is an array of dimension 2, that contains the
 *         16-lower and 15-higher bits of the constant C.
 *
 * IRANN   (local input)                 int *
 *         On entry,  IRANN  is an array of dimension 2,  that contains 
 *         the 16-lower and 15-higher bits of the encoding of X(n).
 *
 * IRANM   (local output)                int *
 *         On entry,  IRANM  is an array of dimension 2.  On exit, this
 *         array contains respectively the 16-lower and  15-higher bits
 *         of the encoding of X(m).
