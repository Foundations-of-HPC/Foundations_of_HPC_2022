/* 
 * Purpose
 * =======
 *
 * HPL_xjumpm computes  the constants  A and C  to jump JUMPM numbers in
 * the random sequence: X(n+JUMPM) = A*X(n)+C.  The constants encoded in
 * MULT and IADD  specify  how to jump from one entry in the sequence to
 * the next.
 *
 * Arguments
 * =========
 *
 * JUMPM   (local input)                 const int
 *         On entry,  JUMPM  specifies  the  number  of entries  in  the
 *         sequence to jump over. When JUMPM is less or equal than zero,
 *         A and C are not computed, IRANM is set to IRANN corresponding
 *         to a jump of size zero.
 *
 * MULT    (local input)                 int *
 *         On entry, MULT is an array of dimension 2,  that contains the
 *         16-lower  and 15-higher bits of the constant  a  to jump from
 *         X(n) to X(n+1) = a*X(n) + c in the random sequence.
 *
 * IADD    (local input)                 int *
 *         On entry, IADD is an array of dimension 2,  that contains the
 *         16-lower  and 15-higher bits of the constant  c  to jump from
 *         X(n) to X(n+1) = a*X(n) + c in the random sequence.
 *
 * IRANN   (local input)                 int *
 *         On entry, IRANN is an array of dimension 2. that contains the
 *         16-lower and 15-higher bits of the encoding of X(n).
 *
 * IRANM   (local output)                int *
 *         On entry,  IRANM  is an array of dimension 2.   On exit, this
 *         array  contains respectively  the 16-lower and 15-higher bits
 *         of the encoding of X(n+JUMPM).
 *
 * IAM     (local output)                int *
 *         On entry, IAM is an array of dimension 2. On exit, when JUMPM
 *         is  greater  than  zero,  this  array  contains  the  encoded
 *         constant  A  to jump from  X(n) to  X(n+JUMPM)  in the random
 *         sequence. IAM(0:1)  contains  respectively  the  16-lower and
 *         15-higher  bits  of this constant  A. When  JUMPM  is less or
 *         equal than zero, this array is not referenced.
 *
 * ICM     (local output)                int *
 *         On entry, ICM is an array of dimension 2. On exit, when JUMPM
 *         is  greater  than  zero,  this  array  contains  the  encoded
 *         constant  C  to jump from  X(n)  to  X(n+JUMPM) in the random
 *         sequence. ICM(0:1)  contains  respectively  the  16-lower and
 *         15-higher  bits  of this constant  C. When  JUMPM  is less or
 *         equal than zero, this array is not referenced.
