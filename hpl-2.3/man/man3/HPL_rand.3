.SH NAME
HPL_rand \- random number generator.
.SH SYNOPSIS
\fB\&#include "hpl.h"\fR
 
\fB\&double\fR
\fB\&HPL_rand();\fR
.SH DESCRIPTION
\fB\&HPL_rand\fR
generates  the next number  in the  random  sequence.  This
function  ensures  that this number lies in the interval (-0.5, 0.5].
 
The static array irand contains the information (2 integers) required
to generate the  next number  in the sequence  X(n).  This  number is
computed as X(n) = (2^32 * irand[1] + irand[0]) / d - 0.5,  where the
constant d is the largest 64 bit positive integer. The array irand is
then  updated  for the generation of the next number  X(n+1)  in  the
random sequence as follows X(n+1) = a * X(n) + c. The constants a and
c  should have been preliminarily stored in the arrays ias and ics as
2 pairs of integers.  The initialization of  ias,  ics and  irand  is
performed by the function HPL_setran.
