.SH DESCRIPTION
\fB\&HPL_pnum\fR
determines  the  rank  of a  process  as a function  of  its
coordinates in the grid.
.SH ARGUMENTS
.TP 8
GRID    (local input)           const HPL_T_grid *
On entry,  GRID  points  to the data structure containing the
process grid information.
.TP 8
MYROW   (local input)           const int
On entry,  MYROW  specifies the row coordinate of the process
whose rank is to be determined. MYROW must be greater than or
equal to zero and less than NPROW.
