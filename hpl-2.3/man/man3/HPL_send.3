.SH DESCRIPTION
\fB\&HPL_send\fR
is a simple wrapper around  MPI_Send.  Its  main  purpose is
to  allow for some  experimentation / tuning  of this simple routine.
Successful  completion  is  indicated  by  the  returned  error  code
MPI_SUCCESS.  In the case of messages of length less than or equal to
zero, this function returns immediately.
.SH ARGUMENTS
.TP 8
SBUF    (local input)           double *
On entry, SBUF specifies the starting address of buffer to be
sent.
.TP 8
SCOUNT  (local input)           int
On entry,  SCOUNT  specifies  the number of  double precision
entries in SBUF. SCOUNT must be at least zero.

DEST    (local input)           int
On entry, DEST specifies the rank of the receiving process in
the communication space defined by COMM.
.TP 8

On entry,  STAG specifies the message tag to be used for this
communication operation.
.TP 8
