.SH NAME
HPL_dlamch \- determines machine-specific arithmetic constants.
.SH SYNOPSIS

\fB\&HPL_dlamch(\fR

.SH DESCRIPTION
\fB\&HPL_dlamch\fR
determines  machine-specific  arithmetic constants such as
the relative machine precision  (eps),  the safe minimum (sfmin) such
that 1 / sfmin does not overflow, the base of the machine (base), the
precision (prec), the  number of (base) digits  in the  mantissa (t),
whether rounding occurs in addition (rnd=1.0 and 0.0 otherwise),  the
minimum exponent before  (gradual)  underflow (emin),  the  underflow
threshold (rmin) base**(emin-1), the largest exponent before overflow
(emax), the overflow threshold (rmax) (base**emax)*(1-eps).

This function has been manually translated from the Fortran 77 LAPACK
auxiliary function dlamch.f  (version 2.0 -- 1992), that  was  itself
based on the function ENVRON  by Malcolm and incorporated suggestions
by Gentleman and Marovich. See
