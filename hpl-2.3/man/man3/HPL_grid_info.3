.SH ARGUMENTS
.TP 8
GRID    (local input)           const HPL_T_grid *
On entry,  GRID  points  to the data structure containing the
process grid information.
.TP 8
NPROW   (global output)         int *
On exit,   NPROW  specifies the number of process rows in the
grid. NPROW is at least one.
.TP 8
NPCOL   (global output)         int *
On exit,   NPCOL  specifies  the number of process columns in
the grid. NPCOL is at least one.
.TP 8
MYROW   (global output)         int *
On exit,  MYROW  specifies my  row process  coordinate in the
grid. MYROW is greater than or equal  to zero  and  less than
NPROW.
.TP 8
MYCOL   (global output)         int *
On exit,  MYCOL specifies my column process coordinate in the
grid. MYCOL is greater than or equal  to zero  and  less than
NPCOL.
