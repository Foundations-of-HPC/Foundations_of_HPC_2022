.SH DESCRIPTION
\fB\&HPL_recv\fR
is a simple wrapper around  MPI_Recv.  Its  main  purpose is
to  allow for some  experimentation / tuning  of this simple routine.
Successful  completion  is  indicated  by  the  returned  error  code
HPL_SUCCESS.  In the case of messages of length less than or equal to
zero, this function returns immediately.
.SH ARGUMENTS
.TP 8
RBUF    (local output)          double *
On entry, RBUF specifies the starting address of buffer to be
received.
.TP 8
RCOUNT  (local input)           int
On entry,  RCOUNT  specifies  the number  of double precision
entries in RBUF. RCOUNT must be at least zero.
.TP 8
SRC     (local input)           int
On entry, SRC  specifies the rank of the  sending  process in
the communication space defined by COMM.
.TP 8
RTAG    (local input)           int
On entry,  STAG specifies the message tag to be used for this
communication operation.
.TP 8
COMM    (local input)           MPI_Comm
The MPI communicator identifying the communication space.
