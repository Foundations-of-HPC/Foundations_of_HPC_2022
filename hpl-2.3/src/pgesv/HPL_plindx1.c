/* 
 * Purpose
 * =======
 *
 * HPL_plindx1 computes two local arrays  LINDXA and  LINDXAU  containing
 * the  local  source and final destination position  resulting from the
 * application of row interchanges.  In addition, this function computes
 * three arrays IPLEN, IPMAP and IPMAPM1  that contain  the  logarithmic
 * mapping information for the spreading phase.
 *
 * Arguments
 * =========
 *
 * PANEL   (local input/output)          HPL_T_panel *
 *         On entry,  PANEL  points to the data structure containing the
 *         panel information.
 *
 * K       (global input)                const int
 *         On entry, K specifies the number of entries in IPID.  K is at
 *         least 2*N, and at most 4*N.
 *
 * IPID    (global input)                const int *
 *         On entry,  IPID  is an array of length K. The first K entries
 *         of that array contain the src and final destination resulting
 *         from the application of the interchanges.
 *
 * IPA     (global output)               int *
 *         On exit,  IPA  specifies  the number of rows that the current
 *         process row has that either belong to U  or should be swapped
 *         with remote rows of A.
 *
 * LINDXA  (global output)               int *
 *         On entry, LINDXA  is an array of dimension 2*N. On exit, this
 *         array contains the local indexes of the rows of A I have that
 *         should be copied into U.
 *
 * LINDXAU (global output)               int *
 *         On exit, LINDXAU  is an array of dimension 2*N. On exit, this
 *         array contains  the local destination  information encoded as
 *         follows.  If LINDXAU(k) >= 0, row  LINDXA(k)  of A  is  to be
 *         copied in U at position LINDXAU(k).  Otherwise, row LINDXA(k)
 *         of A should be locally copied into A(-LINDXAU(k),:).
 *
 * IPLEN   (global output)               int *
 *         On entry, IPLEN is an array of dimension NPROW + 1. On  exit,
 *         this array is such that  IPLEN[i]  is the number of rows of A
 *         in  the  processes  before  process  IPMAP[i]  after the sort
 *         with the convention that IPLEN[nprow]  is the total number of
 *         rows of the panel.  In other words IPLEN[i+1]-IPLEN[i] is the
 *         local number of rows of A that should be moved to the process
 *         IPMAP[i]. IPLEN is such that the number of rows of the source
 *         process  row can be computed as  IPLEN[1] - IPLEN[0], and the
 *         remaining  entries  of  this  array  are  sorted  so that the
 *         quantities IPLEN[i+1] - IPLEN[i] are logarithmically sorted.
 *
 * IPMAP   (global output)               int *
 *         On entry, IPMAP is an array of dimension NPROW. On exit, this
 *         array contains  the logarithmic mapping of the processes.  In
 *         other words, IPMAP[myrow] is the corresponding sorted process
 *         coordinate.
 *
 * IPMAPM1 (global output)               int *
 *         On entry, IPMAPM1  is an array of dimension NPROW.  On  exit,
 *         this  array  contains  the inverse of the logarithmic mapping
 *         contained  in  IPMAP:  IPMAPM1[ IPMAP[i] ] = i,  for all i in
 *         [0.. NPROCS)
 *
 * PERMU   (global output)               int *
 *         On entry,  PERMU  is an array of dimension JB. On exit, PERMU
 *         contains  a sequence of permutations,  that should be applied
 *         in increasing order to permute in place the row panel U.
 *
 * IWORK   (workspace)                   int *
 *         On entry, IWORK is a workarray of dimension 2*JB.
