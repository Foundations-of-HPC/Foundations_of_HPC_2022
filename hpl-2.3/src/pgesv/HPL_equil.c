/* 
 * Purpose
 * =======
 *
 * HPL_equil equilibrates  the  local  pieces  of U, so that on exit to
 * this function, pieces of U contained in every process row are of the
 * same size. This phase makes the rolling phase optimal.  In addition,
 * this  function probes  for  the  column panel L and forwards it when
 * possible.
 *
 * Arguments
 * =========
 *
 * PBCST   (local input/output)          HPL_T_panel *
 *         On entry,  PBCST  points to the data structure containing the
 *         panel (to be broadcast) information.
 *
 * IFLAG   (local input/output)          int *
 *         On entry, IFLAG  indicates  whether or not  the broadcast has
 *         already been completed.  If not,  probing will occur, and the
 *         outcome will be contained in IFLAG on exit.
 *
 * PANEL   (local input/output)          HPL_T_panel *
 *         On entry,  PANEL  points to the data structure containing the
 *         panel (to be equilibrated) information.
 *
 * TRANS   (global input)                const enum HPL_TRANS
 *         On entry, TRANS specifies whether  U  is stored in transposed
 *         or non-transposed form.
 *
 * N       (local input)                 const int
 *         On entry, N  specifies the number of rows or columns of  U. N
 *         must be at least 0.
 *
 * U       (local input/output)          double *
 *         On entry,  U  is an array of dimension (LDU,*) containing the
 *         local pieces of U in each process row.
 *
 * LDU     (local input)                 const int
 *         On entry, LDU specifies the local leading dimension of U. LDU
 *         should be at least MAX(1,IPLEN[nprow]) when  U  is stored  in
 *         non-transposed form, and MAX(1,N) otherwise.
 *
 * IPLEN   (global input)                int *
 *         On entry, IPLEN is an array of dimension NPROW+1.  This array
 *         is such that IPLEN[i+1] - IPLEN[i] is the number of rows of U
 *         in process IPMAP[i].
 *
 * IPMAP   (global input)                const int *
 *         On entry, IPMAP is an array of dimension  NPROW.  This  array
 *         contains  the  logarithmic mapping of the processes. In other
 *         words, IPMAP[myrow]  is the absolute coordinate of the sorted
 *         process.
 *
 * IPMAPM1 (global input)                const int *
 *         On entry, IPMAPM1  is an array of dimension NPROW. This array
 *         contains  the inverse of the logarithmic mapping contained in
 *         IPMAP: For i in [0.. NPROCS) IPMAPM1[IPMAP[i]] = i.
 *
 * IWORK   (workspace)                   int *
 *         On entry, IWORK is a workarray of dimension NPROW+1.
