/* 
 * Purpose
 * =======
 *
 * HPL_plindx10 computes  three arrays  IPLEN,  IPMAP  and  IPMAPM1  that
 * contain the logarithmic mapping information for the spreading phase.
 *
 * Arguments
 * =========
 *
 * PANEL   (local input/output)          HPL_T_panel *
 *         On entry,  PANEL  points to the data structure containing the
 *         panel information.
 *
 * K       (global input)                const int
 *         On entry, K specifies the number of entries in IPID.  K is at
 *         least 2*N, and at most 4*N.
 *
 * IPID    (global input)                const int *
 *         On entry,  IPID  is an array of length K. The first K entries
 *         of that array contain the src and final destination resulting
 *         from the application of the interchanges.
 *
 * IPLEN   (global output)               int *
 *         On entry, IPLEN  is an array of dimension NPROW + 1. On exit,
 *         this array is such that  IPLEN[i]  is the number of rows of A
 *         in the processes  before process IMAP[i] after the sort, with
 *         the convention that IPLEN[nprow] is the total number of rows.
 *         In other words,  IPLEN[i+1] - IPLEN[i] is the local number of
 *         rows of  A  that should be moved for each process.  IPLEN  is
 *         such that the number of rows of the source process row can be
 *         computed as IPLEN[1] - IPLEN[0], and the remaining entries of
 *         this  array are sorted  so  that  the quantities IPLEN[i+1] -
 *         IPLEN[i] are logarithmically sorted.
 *
 * IPMAP   (global output)               int *
 *         On entry, IPMAP is an array of dimension NPROW. On exit, this
 *         array contains  the logarithmic mapping of the processes.  In
 *         other words, IPMAP[myrow] is the corresponding sorted process
 *         coordinate.
 *
 * IPMAPM1 (global output)               int *
 *         On entry, IPMAPM1  is an array of dimension NPROW.  On  exit,
 *         this  array  contains  the inverse of the logarithmic mapping
 *         contained  in  IPMAP:  IPMAPM1[ IPMAP[i] ] = i,  for all i in
 *         [0.. NPROW)
