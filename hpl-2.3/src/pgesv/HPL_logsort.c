 * Purpose
 * =======
 *
 * HPL_logsort computes an array  IPMAP  and  its inverse  IPMAPM1  that
 * contain  the logarithmic sorted processes id with repect to the local
 * number of rows of  U  that they own. This is necessary to ensure that
 * the logarithmic spreading of U is optimal in terms of number of steps
 * and communication volume as well.  In other words,  the larget pieces
 * of U will be sent a minimal number of times.
 *
 * Arguments
 * =========
 *
 * NPROCS  (global input)                const int
 *         On entry, NPROCS  specifies the number of process rows in the
 *         process grid. NPROCS is at least one.
 *
 * ICURROC (global input)                const int
 *         On entry, ICURROC is the source process row.
 *
 * IPLEN   (global input/output)         int *
 *         On entry, IPLEN is an array of dimension NPROCS+1,  such that
 *         IPLEN[0] is 0, and IPLEN[i] contains the number of rows of U,
 *         that process i-1 has.  On exit,  IPLEN[i]  is  the number  of
 *         rows of U  in the processes before process IPMAP[i] after the
 *         sort,  with  the convention that  IPLEN[NPROCS] is  the total
 *         number  of rows  of the panel.  In other words,  IPLEN[i+1] -
 *         IPLEN[i] is  the  number of rows of A that should be moved to
 *         the process IPMAP[i].  IPLEN  is such that the number of rows
 *         of  the  source process  row is IPLEN[1] - IPLEN[0],  and the
 *         remaining  entries  of  this  array  are  sorted  so that the
 *         quantities IPLEN[i+1]-IPLEN[i] are logarithmically sorted.
 *
 * IPMAP   (global output)               int *
 *         On entry,  IPMAP  is an array of dimension  NPROCS.  On exit,
 *         array contains  the logarithmic mapping of the processes.  In
 *         other words, IPMAP[myroc] is the corresponding sorted process
 *         coordinate.
 *
 * IPMAPM1 (global output)               int *
 *         On entry, IPMAPM1  is an array of dimension NPROCS.  On exit,
 *         this  array  contains  the inverse of the logarithmic mapping
 *         contained  in  IPMAP:  IPMAPM1[ IPMAP[i] ] = i,  for all i in
 *         [0.. NPROCS)
