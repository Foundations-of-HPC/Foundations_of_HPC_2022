/* 
 * Purpose
 * =======
 *
 * HPL_perm combines  two  index  arrays  and generate the corresponding
 * permutation. First, this function computes the inverse of LINDXA, and
 * then combine it with LINDXAU.  Second, in order to be able to perform
 * the permutation in place,  LINDXAU  is overwritten by the sequence of
 * permutation  producing  the  same result.  What we ultimately want to
 * achieve is:  U[LINDXAU[i]] := U[LINDXA[i]] for i in [0..N). After the
 * call to this function,  this in place permutation can be performed by
 * for i in [0..N) swap U[i] with U[LINDXAU[i]].
 *
 * Arguments
 * =========
 *
 * N       (global input)                const int
 *         On entry,  N  specifies the length of the arrays  LINDXA  and
 *         LINDXAU. N should be at least zero.
 *
 * LINDXA  (global input/output)         int *
 *         On entry,  LINDXA  is an array of dimension N  containing the
 *         source indexes. On exit,  LINDXA  contains the combined index
 *         array.
 *
 * LINDXAU (global input/output)         int *
 *         On entry,  LINDXAU is an array of dimension N  containing the
 *         target indexes.  On exit,  LINDXAU  contains  the sequence of
 *         permutation,  that  should be applied  in increasing order to
 *         permute the underlying array U in place.
 *
 * IWORK   (workspace)                   int *
 *         On entry, IWORK is a workarray of dimension N.
