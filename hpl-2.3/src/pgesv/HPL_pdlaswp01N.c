/* 
 * Purpose
 * =======
 *
 * HPL_pdlaswp01N applies the  NB  row interchanges to  NN columns of the
 * trailing submatrix and broadcast a column panel.
 *  
 * A "Spread then roll" algorithm performs  the swap :: broadcast  of the
 * row panel U at once,  resulting in a minimal communication volume  and
 * a "very good"  use of the connectivity if available.  With  P  process
 * rows  and  assuming  bi-directional links,  the  running time  of this
 * function can be approximated by:
 *  
 *    (log_2(P)+(P-1)) * lat +   K * NB * LocQ(N) / bdwth
 *  
 * where  NB  is the number of rows of the row panel U,  N is the global
 * number of columns being updated,  lat and bdwth  are the latency  and
 * bandwidth  of  the  network  for  double  precision real words.  K is
 * a constant in (2,3] that depends on the achieved bandwidth  during  a
 * simultaneous  message exchange  between two processes.  An  empirical
 * optimistic value of K is typically 2.4.
 *
 * Arguments
 * =========
 *
 * PBCST   (local input/output)          HPL_T_panel *
 *         On entry,  PBCST  points to the data structure containing the
 *         panel (to be broadcast) information.
 *
 * IFLAG   (local input/output)          int *
 *         On entry, IFLAG  indicates  whether or not  the broadcast has
 *         already been completed.  If not,  probing will occur, and the
 *         outcome will be contained in IFLAG on exit.
 *
 * PANEL   (local input/output)          HPL_T_panel *
 *         On entry,  PANEL  points to the data structure containing the
 *         panel information.
 *
 * NN      (local input)                 const int
 *         On entry, NN specifies  the  local  number  of columns of the
 *         trailing  submatrix  to  be swapped and broadcast starting at
 *         the current position. NN must be at least zero.
