/* 
 * Purpose
 * =======
 *
 * HPL_plindx0 computes two local arrays  LINDXA and  LINDXAU  containing
 * the  local  source and final destination position  resulting from the
 * application of row interchanges.
 *  
 * On entry, the array  IPID  of length K is such that the row of global
 * index  IPID(i)  should be mapped onto row of global index  IPID(i+1).
 * Let  IA  be the global index of the first row to be swapped. For k in
 * [0..K/2), the row of global index IPID(2*k) should be mapped onto the
 * row of global index  IPID(2*k+1).  The question then, is to determine
 * which rows should ultimately be part of U.
 *  
 * First, some rows of the process ICURROW  may be swapped locally.  One
 * of this row belongs to U, the other one belongs to my local  piece of
 * A.  The other  rows of the current block are swapped with remote rows
 * and are thus not part of U. These rows however should be sent  along,
 * and  grabbed by the other processes  as we  progress in the  exchange
 * phase.
 *  
 * So, assume that I am  ICURROW  and consider a row of index  IPID(2*i)
 * that I own. If I own IPID(2*i+1) as well and IPID(2*i+1) - IA is less
 * than N,  this row is locally swapped and should be copied into  U  at
 * the position IPID(2*i+1) - IA. No row will be exchanged for this one.
 * If IPID(2*i+1)-IA is greater than N, then the row IPID(2*i) should be
 * locally copied into my local piece of A at the position corresponding
 * to the row of global index IPID(2*i+1).
 *  
 * If the process  ICURROW does not own  IPID(2*i+1), then row IPID(2*i)
 * is to be swapped away and strictly speaking does not belong to U, but
 * to  A  remotely.  Since this  process will however send this array U,
 * this row is  copied into  U, exactly where the row IPID(2*i+1) should
 * go. For this, we search IPID for k1, such that IPID(2*k1) is equal to
 * IPID(2*i+1); and row  IPID(2*i) is to be copied in U  at the position
 * IPID(2*k1+1)-IA.
 *  
 * It is thus  important to put the rows that go into U, i.e., such that
 * IPID(2*i+1) - IA is less than N at the begining of the array IPID. By
 * doing so,  U  is formed, and the local copy  is performed in just one
 * sweep.
 *  
 * Two lists  LINDXA  and  LINDXAU are built.  LINDXA contains the local
 * index of the rows I have that should be copied. LINDXAU  contains the
 * local destination information: if LINDXAU(k) >= 0, row LINDXA(k) of A
 * is to be copied in U at position LINDXAU(k). Otherwise, row LINDXA(k)
 * of A should be locally copied into A(-LINDXAU(k),:).  In the  process
 * ICURROW, the initial packing algorithm proceeds as follows.
 *  
 *   for all entries in IPID,
 *      if IPID(2*i) is in ICURROW,
 *         if IPID(2*i+1) is in ICURROW,
 *            if( IPID(2*i+1) - IA < N )
 *             save corresponding local position
 *             of this row (LINDXA);
 *             save local position (LINDXAU) in U
 *             where this row goes;
 *             [copy row IPID(2*i) in U at position
 *             IPID(2*i+1)-IA; ];
 *            else
 *             save corresponding local position of
 *             this row (LINDXA);
 *             save local position (-LINDXAU) in A
 *             where this row goes;
 *             [copy row IPID(2*i) in my piece of A
 *             at IPID(2*i+1);]
 *            end if
 *         else
 *            find k1 such that IPID(2*k1) = IPID(2*i+1);
 *            copy row IPID(2*i) in U at position
 *            IPID(2*k1+1)-IA;
 *            save corresponding local position of this
 *            row (LINDXA);
 *            save local position (LINDXAU) in U where
 *            this row goes;
 *         end if
 *      end if
 *   end for
 *  
 * Second, if I am not the current row process  ICURROW, all source rows
 * in IPID that I own are part of U. Indeed,  they  are swapped with one
 * row  of  the  current  block  of rows,  and  the  main  factorization
 * algorithm proceeds one row after each other.  The processes different
 * from ICURROW,  should  exchange and accumulate  those rows until they
 * receive some data previously owned by the process ICURROW.
 *  
 * In processes different from  ICURROW,  the  initial packing algorithm
 * proceeds as follows.  Consider a row of global index IPID(2*i) that I
 * own. When I will be receiving data previously owned by ICURROW, i.e.,
 * U, row IPID(2*i) should  replace the row in U at pos. IPID(2*i+1)-IA,
 * and  this particular row of U should be first copied into my piece of
 * A, at A(il,:),  where  il is the  local row  index  corresponding  to
 * IPID(2*i). Now,initially, this row will be packed into workspace, say
 * as the kth row of  that  work array.  The  following  algorithm  sets
 * LINDXAU[k] to IPID(2*i+1)-IA, that is the position in U where the row
 * should be copied. LINDXA(k) stores the local index in  A  where  this
 * row of U should be copied, i.e il.
 *  
 *   for all entries in IPID,
 *      if IPID(2*i) is not in ICURROW,
 *         copy row IPID(2*i) in work array;
 *         save corresponding local position
 *         of this row (LINDXA);
 *         save position (LINDXAU) in U where
 *         this row should be copied;
 *      end if
 *   end for
 *  
 * Since we are at it, we also globally figure  out  how many rows every
 * process has. That is necessary, because it would rather be cumbersome
 * to  figure it on  the fly  during the  bi-directional exchange phase.
 * This information is kept in the array  LLEN  of size NPROW. Also note
 * that the arrays LINDXA and LINDXAU are of max length equal to 2*N.

 *         On exit, LINDXAU  is an array of dimension 2*N. On exit, this
 *         array contains  the local destination  information encoded as
 *         follows.  If LINDXAU(k) >= 0, row  LINDXA(k)  of A  is  to be
 *         copied in U at position LINDXAU(k).  Otherwise, row LINDXA(k)
 *         of A should be locally copied into A(-LINDXAU(k),:).
 *
 * LLEN    (global output)               int *
 *         On entry,  LLEN  is  an array  of length  NPROW.  On exit, it
