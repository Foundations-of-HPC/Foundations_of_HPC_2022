 * Purpose
 * =======
 *
 * HPL_indxl2g computes the global index of a matrix  entry  pointed to
 * by the local index IL of the process indicated by PROC.
 *
 * Arguments
 * =========
 *
 * IL      (input)                       const int
 *         On entry, IL specifies the local  index of the matrix  entry.
 *         IL must be at least zero.
 *
 * INB     (input)                       const int
 *         On entry,  INB  specifies  the size of the first block of the
 *         global matrix. INB must be at least one.
 *
 * NB      (input)                       const int
 *         On entry,  NB specifies the blocking factor used to partition
 *         and distribute the matrix A. NB must be larger than one.
 *
 * PROC    (input)                       const int
 *         On entry, PROC  specifies the coordinate of the process whose
 *         local array row or column is to be determined. PROC  must  be
 *         at least zero and strictly less than NPROCS.
 *
 * SRCPROC (input)                       const int
 *         On entry,  SRCPROC  specifies  the coordinate of the  process
 *         that possesses the first row or column of the matrix. SRCPROC
 *         must be at least zero and strictly less than NPROCS.
 *
 * NPROCS  (input)                       const int
 *         On entry,  NPROCS  specifies the total number of process rows
 *         or columns over which the matrix is distributed.  NPROCS must
 *         be at least one.
