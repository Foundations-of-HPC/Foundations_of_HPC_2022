 * Purpose
 * =======
 *
 * HPL_pwarn displays an error message.
 * 
 *
 * Arguments
 * =========
 *
 * STREAM  (local input)                 FILE *
 *         On entry, STREAM specifies the output stream.
 *
 * LINE    (local input)                 int
 *         On entry,  LINE  specifies the line  number in the file where
 *         the  error  has  occured.  When  LINE  is not a positive line
 *         number, it is ignored.
 *
 * SRNAME  (local input)                 const char *
 *         On entry, SRNAME  should  be the name of the routine  calling
 *         this error handler.
 *
 * FORM    (local input)                 const char *
 *         On entry, FORM specifies the format, i.e., how the subsequent
 *         arguments are converted for output.
 *
 *         (local input)                 ...
 *         On entry,  ...  is the list of arguments to be printed within
 *         the format string.
