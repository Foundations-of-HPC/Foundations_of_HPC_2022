/* 
 * Purpose
 * =======
 *
 * HPL_pdlamch determines  machine-specific  arithmetic  constants  such  as
 * the relative machine precision (eps),  the safe minimum(sfmin) such that
 * 1/sfmin does not overflow, the base of the machine (base), the precision
 * (prec),  the  number  of  (base)  digits in the  mantissa  (t),  whether
 * rounding occurs in addition (rnd = 1.0 and 0.0 otherwise),  the  minimum
 * exponent before  (gradual)  underflow (emin),  the  underflow  threshold
 * (rmin)- base**(emin-1), the largest exponent before overflow (emax), the
 * overflow threshold (rmax)  - (base**emax)*(1-eps).
 *
 * Arguments
 * =========
 *
 * COMM    (global/local input)          MPI_Comm
 *         The MPI communicator identifying the process collection.
 *
 * CMACH   (global input)                const HPL_T_MACH
 *         Specifies the value to be returned by HPL_pdlamch
