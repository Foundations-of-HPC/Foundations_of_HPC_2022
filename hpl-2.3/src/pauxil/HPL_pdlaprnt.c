/* 
 * Purpose
 * =======
 *
 * HPL_pdlaprnt prints  to  standard  error a distributed matrix A. The
 * local pieces of  A  are sent to the process of coordinates  (0,0)  in
 * the grid and then printed.
 *
 * Arguments
 * =========
 *
 * GRID    (local input)                 const HPL_T_grid *
 *         On entry,  GRID  points  to the data structure containing the
 *         process grid information.
 *
 * M       (global input)                const int
 *         On entry,  M  specifies the number of rows of the coefficient
 *         matrix A. M must be at least zero.
 *
 * N       (global input)                const int
 *         On  entry,   N   specifies  the  number  of  columns  of  the
 *         coefficient matrix A. N must be at least zero.
 *
 * NB      (global input)                const int
 *         On entry,  NB specifies the blocking factor used to partition
 *         and distribute the matrix. NB must be larger than one.
 *
 * A       (local input)                 double *
 *         On entry,  A  points to an  array of dimension (LDA,LocQ(N)).
 *         This array contains the coefficient matrix to be printed.
 *
 * LDA     (local input)                 const int
 *         On entry, LDA specifies the leading dimension of the array A.
 *         LDA must be at least max(1,LocP(M)).
 *
 * IAROW   (global input)                const int
 *         On entry,  IAROW  specifies the row process coordinate owning
 *         the  first row of A.  IAROW  must be  larger than or equal to
 *         zero and less than NPROW.
 *
 * IACOL   (global input)                const int
 *         On entry,  IACOL  specifies  the  column  process  coordinate
 *         owning the  first column  of A. IACOL  must be larger than or
 *         equal to zero and less than NPCOL.
 *
 * CMATNM  (global input)                const char *
 *         On entry, CMATNM is the name of the matrix to be printed.
