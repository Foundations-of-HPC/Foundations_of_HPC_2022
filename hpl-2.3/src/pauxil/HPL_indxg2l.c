 * Purpose
 * =======
 *
 * HPL_indxg2l computes  the local index of a matrix entry pointed to by
 * the  global index IG.  This  local  returned index is the same in all
 * processes.
 *
 * Arguments
 * =========
 *
 * IG      (input)                       const int
 *         On entry, IG specifies the global index of the matrix  entry.
 *         IG must be at least zero.
 *
 * INB     (input)                       const int
 *         On entry,  INB  specifies  the size of the first block of the
 *         global matrix. INB must be at least one.
 *
 * NB      (input)                       const int
 *         On entry,  NB specifies the blocking factor used to partition
 *         and distribute the matrix. NB must be larger than one.
 *
 * SRCPROC (input)                       const int
 *         On entry, if SRCPROC = -1, the data  is not  distributed  but
 *         replicated,  in  which  case  this  routine returns IG in all
 *         processes. Otherwise, the value of SRCPROC is ignored.
 *
 * NPROCS  (input)                       const int
 *         On entry,  NPROCS  specifies the total number of process rows
 *         or columns over which the matrix is distributed.  NPROCS must
 *         be at least one.

 * whether  IG  resides in the process owning the first partial block of
 * size INB (MYROC=0). To determine this cheaply, let i = (IG-INB) / NB,
 * so that if NPROCS divides i+1, i.e. MYROC=0,  we have i+1 = l*NPROCS.
 * If we set  j = i / NPROCS, it follows that j = l-1. Therefore, i+1 is
 * equal to (j+1) * NPROCS.  Conversely, if NPROCS does not divide  i+1, 
 * then i+1 = l*NPROCS + MYROC with 1 <= MYROC < NPROCS. It follows that

 * Using the above notation,  we have i+1 = l*NPROCS + MYROC = l*NPROCS,
 * i.e l = ( i+1 ) / NPROCS = j+1,  since  NPROCS divides i+1, therefore
 * IL = IG + ( j + 1 - ( i + 1 ) ) * NB.
 *
 * Otherwise when MYROC >= 1, the result IL can be written as:
 * IL = l * NB + X = IG - INB + ( ( l+1 ) - ( l * NPROCS + MYROC ) )*NB.
 * We still have i+1 = l*NPROCS+MYROC. Since NPROCS does not divide i+1,
