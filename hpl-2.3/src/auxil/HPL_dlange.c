 * Purpose
 * =======
 *
 * HPL_dlange returns  the value of the one norm,  or the infinity norm,
 * or the element of largest absolute value of a matrix A:              
 *  
 *    max(abs(A(i,j))) when NORM = HPL_NORM_A,                          
 *    norm1(A),        when NORM = HPL_NORM_1,                          
 *    normI(A),        when NORM = HPL_NORM_I,                          
 *  
 * where norm1 denotes the one norm of a matrix (maximum column sum) and
 * normI denotes  the infinity norm of a matrix (maximum row sum).  Note
 * that max(abs(A(i,j))) is not a matrix norm.
 *
 * Arguments
 * =========
 *
 * NORM    (local input)                 const HPL_T_NORM
 *         On entry,  NORM  specifies  the  value to be returned by this
 *         function as described above.
 *
 * M       (local input)                 const int
 *         On entry,  M  specifies  the number  of rows of the matrix A.
 *         M must be at least zero.
 *
 * N       (local input)                 const int
 *         On entry,  N specifies the number of columns of the matrix A.
 *         N must be at least zero.
 *
 * A       (local input)                 const double *
 *         On entry,  A  points to an  array of dimension  (LDA,N), that
 *         contains the matrix A.
 *
 * LDA     (local input)                 const int
 *         On entry, LDA specifies the leading dimension of the array A.
 *         LDA must be at least max(1,M).
