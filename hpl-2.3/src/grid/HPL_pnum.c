 * Purpose

 * =========
 *
 * GRID    (local input)                 const HPL_T_grid *
 *         On entry,  GRID  points  to the data structure containing the
 *         process grid information.
 *
 * MYROW   (local input)                 const int
 *         On entry,  MYROW  specifies the row coordinate of the process
 *         whose rank is to be determined. MYROW must be greater than or
 *         equal to zero and less than NPROW.
 *
 * MYCOL   (local input)                 const int
 *         On entry,  MYCOL  specifies  the  column  coordinate  of  the
 *         process whose rank is to be determined. MYCOL must be greater
 *         than or equal to zero and less than NPCOL.
