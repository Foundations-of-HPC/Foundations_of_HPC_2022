/* 
 * Purpose
 * =======
 *
 * HPL_grid_init creates a NPROW x NPCOL  process  grid using column- or
 * row-major ordering from an initial collection of processes identified
 * by an  MPI  communicator.  Successful  completion is indicated by the
 * returned error code MPI_SUCCESS.  Other error codes depend on the MPI
 * implementation. The coordinates of processes that are not part of the
 * grid are set to values outside of [0..NPROW) x [0..NPCOL).
 *
 * Arguments
 * =========
 *
 * COMM    (global/local input)          MPI_Comm
 *         On entry,  COMM  is  the  MPI  communicator  identifying  the
 *         initial  collection  of  processes out of which  the  grid is
 *         formed.
 *
 * ORDER   (global input)                const HPL_T_ORDER
 *         On entry, ORDER specifies how the processes should be ordered
 *         in the grid as follows:
 *            ORDER = HPL_ROW_MAJOR    row-major    ordering;
 *            ORDER = HPL_COLUMN_MAJOR column-major ordering;
 *
 * NPROW   (global input)                const int
 *         On entry,  NPROW  specifies the number of process rows in the
 *         grid to be created. NPROW must be at least one.
 *
 * NPCOL   (global input)                const int
 *         On entry,  NPCOL  specifies  the number of process columns in
 *         the grid to be created. NPCOL must be at least one.
 *
 * GRID    (local input/output)          HPL_T_grid *
 *         On entry,  GRID  points  to the data structure containing the
 *         process grid information to be initialized.
