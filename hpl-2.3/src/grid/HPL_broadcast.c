/* 
 * Purpose
 * =======
 *
 * HPL_broadcast broadcasts  a message from the process with rank ROOT to
 * all processes in the group.
 *
 * Arguments
 * =========
 *
 * BUFFER  (local input/output)          void *
 *         On entry,  BUFFER  points to  the  buffer to be broadcast. On
 *         exit, this array contains the broadcast data and is identical
 *         on all processes in the group.
 *
 * COUNT   (global input)                const int
 *         On entry,  COUNT  indicates the number of entries in  BUFFER.
 *         COUNT must be at least zero.
 *
 * DTYPE   (global input)                const HPL_T_TYPE
 *         On entry,  DTYPE  specifies the type of the buffers operands.
 *
 * ROOT    (global input)                const int
 *         On entry, ROOT is the coordinate of the source process.
 *
 * COMM    (global/local input)          MPI_Comm
 *         The MPI communicator identifying the process collection.
