 * Purpose
 * =======
 *
 * HPL_grid_info returns  the grid shape and the coordinates in the grid
 * of the calling process.  Successful  completion  is  indicated by the
 * returned error code  MPI_SUCCESS. Other error codes depend on the MPI
 * implementation.
 *
 * Arguments
 * =========
 *
 * GRID    (local input)                 const HPL_T_grid *
 *         On entry,  GRID  points  to the data structure containing the
 *         process grid information.
 *
 * NPROW   (global output)               int *
 *         On exit,   NPROW  specifies the number of process rows in the
 *         grid. NPROW is at least one.
 *
 * NPCOL   (global output)               int *
 *         On exit,   NPCOL  specifies  the number of process columns in
 *         the grid. NPCOL is at least one.
 *
 * MYROW   (global output)               int *
 *         On exit,  MYROW  specifies my  row process  coordinate in the
 *         grid. MYROW is greater than or equal  to zero  and  less than
 *         NPROW.
 *
 * MYCOL   (global output)               int *
 *         On exit,  MYCOL specifies my column process coordinate in the
 *         grid. MYCOL is greater than or equal  to zero  and  less than
 *         NPCOL.
