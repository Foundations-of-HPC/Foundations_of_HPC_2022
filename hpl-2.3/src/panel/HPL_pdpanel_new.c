 * Purpose
 * =======
 *
 * HPL_pdpanel_new creates and initializes a panel data structure.
 * 
 *
 * Arguments
 * =========
 *
 * GRID    (local input)                 HPL_T_grid *
 *         On entry,  GRID  points  to the data structure containing the
 *         process grid information.
 *
 * ALGO    (global input)                HPL_T_palg *
 *         On entry,  ALGO  points to  the data structure containing the
 *         algorithmic parameters.
 *
 * M       (local input)                 const int
 *         On entry, M specifies the global number of rows of the panel.
 *         M must be at least zero.
 *
 * N       (local input)                 const int
 *         On entry,  N  specifies  the  global number of columns of the
 *         panel and trailing submatrix. N must be at least zero.
 *
 * JB      (global input)                const int
 *         On entry, JB specifies is the number of columns of the panel.
 *         JB must be at least zero.
 *
 * A       (local input/output)          HPL_T_pmat *
 *         On entry, A points to the data structure containing the local
 *         array information.
 *
 * IA      (global input)                const int
 *         On entry,  IA  is  the global row index identifying the panel
 *         and trailing submatrix. IA must be at least zero.
 *
 * JA      (global input)                const int
 *         On entry, JA is the global column index identifying the panel
 *         and trailing submatrix. JA must be at least zero.
 *
 * TAG     (global input)                const int
 *         On entry, TAG is the row broadcast message id.
 *
 * PANEL   (local input/output)          HPL_T_panel * *
 *         On entry,  PANEL  points  to  the  address  of the panel data
 *         structure to create and initialize.
