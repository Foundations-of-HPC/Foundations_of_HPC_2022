/* 
 * Purpose
 * =======
 *
 * HPL_pdpanrlN factorizes  a panel of columns  that is a sub-array of a
 * larger one-dimensional panel A using the Right-looking variant of the
 * usual one-dimensional algorithm.  The lower triangular N0-by-N0 upper
 * block of the panel is stored in no-transpose form (i.e. just like the
 * input matrix itself).
 *  
 * Bi-directional  exchange  is  used  to  perform  the  swap::broadcast
 * operations  at once  for one column in the panel.  This  results in a
 * lower number of slightly larger  messages than usual.  On P processes
 * and assuming bi-directional links,  the running time of this function
 * can be approximated by (when N is equal to N0):
 *  
 *    N0 * log_2( P ) * ( lat + ( 2*N0 + 4 ) / bdwth ) +
 *    N0^2 * ( M - N0/3 ) * gam2-3
 *  
 * where M is the local number of rows of  the panel, lat and bdwth  are
 * the latency and bandwidth of the network for  double  precision  real
 * words, and  gam2-3  is  an estimate of the  Level 2 and Level 3  BLAS
 * rate of execution. The  recursive  algorithm  allows indeed to almost
 * achieve  Level 3 BLAS  performance  in the panel factorization.  On a
 * large  number of modern machines,  this  operation is however latency
 * bound,  meaning  that its cost can  be estimated  by only the latency
 * portion N0 * log_2(P) * lat.  Mono-directional links will double this
 * communication cost.
 *  
 * Note that  one  iteration of the the main loop is unrolled. The local
 * computation of the absolute value max of the next column is performed
 * just after its update by the current column. This allows to bring the
 * current column only  once through  cache at each  step.  The  current
 * implementation  does not perform  any blocking  for  this sequence of
 * BLAS operations, however the design allows for plugging in an optimal
 * (machine-specific) specialized  BLAS-like kernel.  This idea has been
 * suggested to us by Fred Gustavson, IBM T.J. Watson Research Center.
 *
 * Arguments
 * =========
 *
 * PANEL   (local input/output)          HPL_T_panel *
 *         On entry,  PANEL  points to the data structure containing the
 *         panel information.
 *
 * M       (local input)                 const int
 *         On entry,  M specifies the local number of rows of sub(A).
 *
 * N       (local input)                 const int
 *         On entry,  N specifies the local number of columns of sub(A).
 *
 * ICOFF   (global input)                const int
 *         On entry, ICOFF specifies the row and column offset of sub(A)
 *         in A.
 *
 * WORK    (local workspace)             double *
 *         On entry, WORK  is a workarray of size at least 2*(4+2*N0).
