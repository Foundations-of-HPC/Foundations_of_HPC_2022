/* 
 * Purpose
 * =======
 *
 * HPL_dger performs the rank 1 operation
 *  
 *     A := alpha * x * y^T + A,
 *  
 * where alpha is a scalar,  x is an m-element vector, y is an n-element
 * vector and A is an m by n matrix.
 *
 * Arguments
 * =========
 *
 * ORDER   (local input)                 const enum HPL_ORDER
 *         On entry, ORDER  specifies the storage format of the operands
 *         as follows:                                                  
 *            ORDER = HplRowMajor,                                      
 *            ORDER = HplColumnMajor.                                   
 *
 * M       (local input)                 const int
 *         On entry,  M  specifies  the number of rows of  the matrix A.
 *         M must be at least zero.
 *
 * N       (local input)                 const int
 *         On entry, N  specifies the number of columns of the matrix A.
 *         N must be at least zero.
 *
 * ALPHA   (local input)                 const double
 *         On entry, ALPHA specifies the scalar alpha.   When  ALPHA  is
 *         supplied as zero then  X and Y  need not be set on input.
 *
 * X       (local input)                 const double *
 *         On entry,  X  is an incremented array of dimension  at  least
 *         ( 1 + ( m - 1 ) * abs( INCX ) )  that  contains the vector x.
 *
 * INCX    (local input)                 const int
 *         On entry, INCX specifies the increment for the elements of X.
 *         INCX must not be zero.
 *
 * Y       (local input)                 double *
 *         On entry,  Y  is an incremented array of dimension  at  least
 *         ( 1 + ( n - 1 ) * abs( INCY ) )  that  contains the vector y.
 *
 * INCY    (local input)                 const int
 *         On entry, INCY specifies the increment for the elements of Y.
 *         INCY must not be zero.
 *
 * A       (local input/output)          double *
 *         On entry,  A  points  to an array of size equal to or greater
 *         than LDA * n.  Before  entry, the leading m by n part  of the
 *         array  A  must contain the matrix coefficients. On exit, A is
 *         overwritten by the updated matrix.
 *
 * LDA     (local input)                 const int
 *         On entry,  LDA  specifies  the  leading  dimension  of  A  as
 *         declared  in  the  calling  (sub) program.  LDA  must  be  at
 *         least MAX(1,m).
