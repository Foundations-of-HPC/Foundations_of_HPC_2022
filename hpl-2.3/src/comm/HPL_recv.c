/* 
 * Purpose
 * =======
 *
 * HPL_recv is a simple wrapper around  MPI_Recv.  Its  main  purpose is
 * to  allow for some  experimentation / tuning  of this simple routine.
 * Successful  completion  is  indicated  by  the  returned  error  code
 * HPL_SUCCESS.  In the case of messages of length less than or equal to
 * zero, this function returns immediately.
 *
 * Arguments
 * =========
 *
 * RBUF    (local output)                double *
 *         On entry, RBUF specifies the starting address of buffer to be
 *         received.
 *
 * RCOUNT  (local input)                 int
 *         On entry,  RCOUNT  specifies  the number  of double precision
 *         entries in RBUF. RCOUNT must be at least zero.
 *
 * SRC     (local input)                 int
 *         On entry, SRC  specifies the rank of the  sending  process in
 *         the communication space defined by COMM.
 *
 * RTAG    (local input)                 int
 *         On entry,  STAG specifies the message tag to be used for this
 *         communication operation.
 *
 * COMM    (local input)                 MPI_Comm
 *         The MPI communicator identifying the communication space.
