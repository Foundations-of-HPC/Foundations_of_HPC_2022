 * Purpose
 * =======
 *
 * HPL_bcast broadcasts  the  current  panel.  Successful  completion is
 * indicated by IFLAG set to HPL_SUCCESS on return. IFLAG will be set to
 * HPL_FAILURE on failure and to HPL_KEEP_TESTING when the operation was
 * not completed, in which case this function should be called again.
 *
 * Arguments
 * =========
 *
 * PANEL   (input/output)                HPL_T_panel *
 *         On entry,  PANEL  points to the  current panel data structure
 *         being broadcast.
 *
 * IFLAG   (output)                      int *
 *         On exit,  IFLAG  indicates  whether  or not the broadcast has
 *         occured.
